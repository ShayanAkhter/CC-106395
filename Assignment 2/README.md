# Java, is it compiled or interpreted language ❓

Java has a two-step compilation process. first, java source code is compiled down to bytecode by the java compiler, then the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) (which is a software-based interpreter) executes the bytecode or rather converts bytecode into machine code which is understood by the CPU to execute the program. So technically speaking, java is both compiled and interpreted language.
